This includes: 3-5 sites for design reference, a few examples of features they like, a list of their competitors, and any additional information they'd like to provide. In the best case scenario, the client can provide me with all of the images and content that they would like to include on the site.  I then research the field they are in, distill their list of features, and come up with a loose design for the home page and for one of the sub pages.",
      "I use Adobe XD to design and prototype my projects, but have used Sketch and Figma in the past. Xd allows me create desktop and mobile designs quickly and has great prototyping so the client can navigate the site links and get an idea of the the UX of the site during the design phase. During this first phase of design I generally create a design system for the project, including color scheme, typography, spacing, button styles, etc.",
      "After initial feedback from the client I then design the rest of the pages for the project, in both desktop and mobile sizes. This provides the client with a full picture of how the site will look, and makes the styling of the development process a breeze.
