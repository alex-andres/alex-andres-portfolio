I used firebase as a place to store page content, user input from forms, and store files submitted by users. I built API endpoints using Next.js and Node. I also used Firebase Cloud Functions to deploy the NextJS server that is required for Next projects.",

      "Two chanllenges I had with this project was deploying the NextJS server to Firebase and getting the next-optimized-images library to work in deployment. Their is limited information on how to deploy a NextJS Server on a third party server because Vercel the creators of next encourage you to use their own server. After a lot of reconfiguring and 30 different variations of deploys I got the Next server to finally work, with the end resolution being that the server function folder required all of the npm packages that the actual project included. ",
      "After getting the project deployed none of the image optimization that worked in the development environment was working. This is due to the fact that the next Img component only works with deploying the server to Vercel. I came across next-optimize-image as an alternative, and now all of the images are optimized for different screen sizes during build time.",
